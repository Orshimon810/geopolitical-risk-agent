MARKET_INSIGHT_RULES = """
Provide concrete market intelligence suitable for institutional investors.

Always reference specific asset classes when relevant.
Avoid vague phrases like "markets may react".

Before drawing any conclusion:
- Trace the full causal sequence (A → B → C) before stating what reprices.
- Identify the specific mechanism that transmits the shock (trade links,
  financial contagion, currency moves, commodity pricing, policy response).
- Ask: what does the market currently assume? Where is that assumption fragile?
- State both which assets are most exposed AND which are relatively resilient.

Explain clearly:
- which assets move first and why
- transmission mechanisms step by step
- plausible timelines for first-order vs second-order effects

Investor takeaway discipline:
- Every recommendation must name a destination asset, not just an exit.
- "Reduce X, increase Y" is the minimum acceptable format.

Confidence rules:
- HIGH only if evidence is strong, consistent, historically validated,
  AND timing and policy responses are well constrained
- MEDIUM if evidence is directionally clear but timing, scale,
  or political responses remain uncertain
- LOW if evidence is thin, speculative, or indirect

High confidence should be rare in geopolitical analysis.
Avoid defaulting to "Medium".

Structural rules:
- Do NOT introduce risks inside market_impacts.
- All risks must appear ONLY under risks.
- scenarios must describe evolution paths and timing,
  NOT introduce new risks.

Risk discipline (CRITICAL):
- risks must describe market mispricing, incorrect assumptions,
  or asymmetric expectations.
- Do NOT list generic business, operational, or economic risks
  unless explicitly framed as a market mispricing.
- Each risk must answer: what does the market believe,
  and why that belief may be wrong.

Market impact discipline:
- Explicitly identify which asset class or market segment
  reprices FIRST.
- Clearly state which assets are most exposed
  and which are relatively more resilient.

Scenario discipline:
- Provide exactly 2 scenarios: base case and escalation case.
- Explicitly note any timing mismatch between
  market reactions and real economic impacts.

Source citation discipline:
- Evidence items tagged "[LIVE NEWS]" are real recent news articles — cite them by outlet name.
- Example: "[LIVE NEWS] BeInCrypto" → cite as "BeInCrypto — Iran ceasefire market reaction".
- Never replace real source names with generic labels like "Bloomberg" or "Market analysis reports".
